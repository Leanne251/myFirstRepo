            <h4>So, as I've decided to give up my job to take the exciting adventure to learn to code, i figured money might be a little tight for Christmas this year - so why not make my own gifts!
            I started looking into making my own skincare. As shop bought products can have a lot of nasties in them and chemicals you can;t even pronounce I thought nice, hand-made natual products could be a great personal gift for my loved ones. 
            So this is what lead me to my research into Essential Oils. To be honest, I previously thought they were just used to make the room smell nice - but as I've read up on them each one has it's own health & wellbeing benefits. Here I'll share a few little secrets I've found out. </h4>
