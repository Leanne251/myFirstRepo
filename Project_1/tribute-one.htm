        <h3> How Essential Oils can be used in skincare </h3>
        <p> It is important that essential oils are combined with a carrier oils.
          The potency of essential oil can cause skin irritation if not diluted and a little goes a long way.
  
          To dilute your essential oils to be used with skin care, combine them with a carrier oil such as Sweet Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil or Coconute Oil. All of which have great skincare benefits themselves, adding moisture and nurishment when applied. You can also add cocoa butter to make a cream & try whipping with your electric whisk for a really luxurious finish! </p>
